# Applied Data Science Course – GitHub Repository

## Overview
This repository contains all the work and assignments completed for the **Applied Data Science** course. It includes various machine learning tasks such as regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification applied to real-world datasets.

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Regression and classification model building
- Model evaluation and metrics analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Handling imbalanced datasets and oversampling
- Visualization of results and feature importance

## Structure
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for each assignment/task
- **Data:** Dataset files used for analysis (if applicable)
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for reusable functions and pipelines
- **Plots:** Visualization outputs from analysis

## Purpose
The repository serves as a record of practical applications of data science concepts learned during the course, including:
- Predictive modeling
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Handling of real-world dataset challenges
- Use of popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
